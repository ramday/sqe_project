### Test Automation with Docker and CI/CD
This project demonstrates a containerized approach to test automation integrated with a CI/CD pipeline using Docker and GitHub Actions.

### Features
Dockerization: Encapsulates test automation tools and dependencies in a Docker container for consistent and portable execution.

CI/CD Pipeline: Automated builds, tests, and deployments triggered on GitHub events.

GitHub Actions: Implements a robust workflow for building, testing, and pushing Docker images to Docker Hub.

Scalability: Supports seamless testing across various environments using Docker.

Customization: Configurable test triggers and extensible to additional tools and platforms.

Monitoring: Integration with Slack/Email for build notifications (optional).

### Prerequisites
Docker: Install Docker on your local machine to build and run containers.

Install Docker
GitHub Repository: Set up a GitHub repository with Actions enabled.

Secrets Configuration: Configure your Docker Hub credentials in GitHub Secrets:

DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username (must be lowercase).
DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub password or token.

### How to Use
# 1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/ramday/sqe_project.git
   

# 2. Configure Docker Hub Credentials
In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions and add the following secrets:

DOCKER_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username (must be lowercase).
DOCKER_PASSWORD: Your Docker Hub password/token.

# 3. Modify the docker-ci.yml Workflow
Ensure your GitHub Actions workflow is configured to use your Docker Hub credentials and repository-specific details.

# 4. Trigger the Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline will trigger automatically on:

Push events to the main branch.
Manual trigger via GitHub's Workflow Dispatch feature.

# 5. Monitor Build Status
The workflow will automatically:

Check out the repository.
Log in to Docker Hub.
Build the Docker image.
Push the image to Docker Hub.
Example GitHub Actions Workflow (docker-ci.yml)

name: Docker CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on pushes to the main branch
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering from GitHub UI

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Docker Buildx (needed for advanced Docker builds)
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      # Step 3: Log in to Docker Hub
      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      # Step 4: Build Docker image with your Docker Hub username in lowercase and commit SHA tag
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t yourusername/test-automation:${{ github.sha }} .

      # Step 5: Push Docker image to Docker Hub
        run: |
          docker push yourusername/test-automation:${{ github.sha }}

# Additional Configuration
Slack/Email Notifications
You can add steps for Slack or email notifications to notify users about pipeline success or failure. Here's an example for email notifications via SMTP (configured in GitHub Secrets):

SMTP_SERVER: Your SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com).
SMTP_USERNAME: The email address you use to send emails.
SMTP_PASSWORD: The email password or token.
TO_EMAIL: The recipient email addresses.
Add this to your workflow under steps to send notifications after the build step.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates a full CI/CD pipeline for Docker-based test automation.
It integrates test automation with Docker containers and GitHub Actions for a seamless workflow.
By following this guide, you can set up a robust, scalable, and automated testing environment for your projects.
